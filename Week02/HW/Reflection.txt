It mainly covers something we need to know before making a webpage, start making a draft of the web page early, get some external feedback, and use the right tools. 
These are very important for web design. This is to ensure that we maintain efficiency and a good result when designing web pages. 
This article focuses on some important steps in UIUX design. For my recipe pages, the main users are probably going to be people who cook. 
Therefore, I think it is very important to help people get better information when they are cooking. 
In addition, it is also important to do some research with users. 
This research may help us understand how users are going to use our recipes website for information or what their ideal web page would look like.
 I think these will all contribute to the UIUX section of this page.
